<p>Your final payoff depends on the decision you made in round 2 and others' decisions in round 1. In round 1,
    your groupmates on average contributed {{session.vars.avg_contri}},
    you decided to contribute {{session.vars.condi_choice}} in round 2 when the average contribution of your group members is {{session.vars.avg_contri}}.
    The results are thus:
</p>
<div class="card bg-light m-3">
    <div class="card-body">
<p>
    You contributed: <b>{{session.vars.condi_choice}}</b>.<br>
    Your group total contribution: <b>{{ group.tot_contri }}</b>.<br>
    Your earnings from the POOL: <b>{{ group.individual_share }}</b>.<br>
    Your profit in the game is therefore <b>{{ player.payoff }}</b>.
</p>
    </div>
