    As of now, you might realize that if everybody catches {{quota}} fish, your group's aggregate (and average) earnings would be maximized.
    By catching over {{quota}} fish, the fish will be caught too fast (the fish population in the lake will not be sustainable). This may result in fewer fish
    for everyone.  <b>Until further notice, one player of each group will be randomly chosen to be audited each round.
    This playerâ€™s extraction will be shown to every member of the group.</b>
