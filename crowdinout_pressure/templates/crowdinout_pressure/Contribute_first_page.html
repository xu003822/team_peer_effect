<p>
    Your group of
    {{ Constants.players_per_group }} players share a fishery resource of 200 fish. In this round, each group member decides how many fish
    between 0 and 40 to catch. At the end of the round, the number of fish doubles, up to the lake's
    capacity of 200 fish and is divided equally among the group members. Please enter the number of fish you would like to catch in this round. The image below might help you understand your group's situation.
