<p>In this round, your team's final payoff depends on the decision made in round 2. In round 1,
    the other three teams on average contribute {{group.tot_other_avg}},
    your team decided to contribute {{participant.vars.condi_choice}} in round 2.
    (Note, we follow the standard rule of rounding here,
    if the average is greater than or equal to 0.5, we round up to 1; otherwise, we round down to 0).
    Thus the results for this game are:
</p>
<div class="card bg-light m-3">
    <div class="card-body">
<p>
    Your team contributed: <b>{{participant.vars.condi_choice}}</b>.<br>
    The total contribution to the POOL: <b>{{ group.tot_contri }}</b>.<br>
    Your team's earnings from the POOL: <b>{{ group.individual_share }}</b>.<br>
    Your team's profit in the game is therefore <b>{{ player.payoff }}</b>.<br>
    Your profit in the game is therefore <b>{{ player.payoff }}</b>.
