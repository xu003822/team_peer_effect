    your group of
    {{ Constants.players_per_group }} players has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in
        the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0
        to {{ Constants.endowment }}. The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The
        contributions of all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants are
        added up, the total contribution is multiplied by a factor of {{ Constants.multiplier }}, and the
        resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
        evenly split among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }}
        participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus
        the amount you did not contribute. Please enter the number of token you would like to contribute to the public project.
