<!--<p>
Before we begin,  we want to thank you all for accepting this invitation and participating in this exercise.
The objective of this exercise is to understand how people make decisions related to the use of a shared natural resource.
    All the decisions you make, as well as all the other information you will provide us, will remain confidential.</p>-->

        Instructions
    </h3>

<p>
    Welcome to the experiment.  This is an experiment funded by research foundations to study decision making.
    For showing up on time, you will be paid a $5 show-up fee.  In addition, you may receive additional earnings
    as the result of the outcomes in this session.  All earnings that you make will be in “tokens”. At the end of
    the experiment we will pay you in cash an amount equal to $0.25 for every token you earn.
    Today’s session will take about an hour and a half.
</p>

        <b>Decisions:</b> <br>

        <p> At the beginning of this decision-making experiment you will be matched with two other players,
            randomly selected from the people in this room, to form a team of three. You will remain in this
            team of three players for the duration of the experiment. The identity of
            the other players of your team will not be revealed. Your team will play a game with three other teams in the experiment.

            Each team will receive {{ Constants.endowment }}  tokens at the beginning of this experiment. The experiment has
            <b>two independent rounds</b>. In the first round, each team decides how much of the {{ Constants.endowment }}  tokens to keep, and
            how much to contribute to a public POOL that is shared by all the four teams: Your team can contribute
            any number between 0 and {{ Constants.endowment }}  and only whole numbers will be accepted. In the second round, your team will be asked
            to indicate conditional contribution levels for each of the 21 possible average contribution levels
            {0, 1, 2, …, 20} of the other three teams.
            </p>

        <b>Payoffs:</b> <br>

        <p><b>Your earning will equal your team’s earning; everyone in your team will have the same earning.</b>
            Your team's earning from the game is the amount your team did not contribute to the POOL plus the return from the POOL.
        Each team’s return from the POOL is calculated as follows: The total contribution from all four teams to the POOL is multiplied by a factor of 2,
        which is the total earning for the four teams. The total earning is then split equally among all 4 teams, regardless
        of their contribution to the POOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, the computer program will randomly select <b>three</b> teams. The total contribution
            to the POOL is the sum of these three teams' first round contribution plus the fourth team's second round
            contribution from the binding condition. The binding condition is determined by the other three teams’ actual
            average contribution in the first round.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the selected three teams, the first round’s outcome determines their final payoffs. Each team’s final
            payoff is the return from the POOL plus the amount this team didn't contribute in the first round. For the
            selected fourth team, the second round’s outcome determines the final payoff. This team’s final payoff is the earnings
            from the POOL plus the amount it didn't contribute in the second round.
        </p>

                <b>Decision rule within a team:</b> <br>
           <p>Within a team, each team member will propose a contribution level each round. If at least two members propose the same amount,
               that amount becomes the team contribution level. Otherwise, team members go back
               to propose again until two or more team members propose the same amount. Before proposing the contribution,
               members within a team can chat communicate with each other in an anonymous chat room. </p>

<p> <b>Example:</b><br>

Assume in the first round your team decides to contribute 0 tokens and the other three teams contribute 8, 10, 12 respectively. And in the
    second round, your team decide to contribute 20
    tokens if the other teams contribute 10 on average. Imagine that the computer program randomly selects your team's second-round decision (i.e., your team is the
    fourth team) and other three teams' first round decisions to constitute the total contribution to the POOL. In the first round, the other three
    teams' average contribution is (8+10+12)/3=10, and in the second round your team decides to contribute 20 when the average is 10. The total contribution to
    the POOL is thus 20+10*3 = 50. The total contribution is then multiplied by a factor of 2, and the resulting amount is the total earning from the POOL,
    which is evenly split among all 4 teams. Thus your team gets 50*2/4=25 from the POOL. Your team's final payoff equals your team's earning from the POOL, 25, plus the amount
    your team did not contribute in the second round, 0, resulting in 25. Since each team member's payoff is the same as the team's payoff, your final payoff is also 25.
    The other three teams' final payoffs equal their earnings from the POOL, 25, plus what
    they did not contribute in the first round. Therefore, for the team who contributes 8 to the POOL in the first round, the final payoff is the earning
    from the POOL, 25, plus the amount it did not contribute, 12, which results in a final payoff of 37. For the team who contributes 10 to the POOL
    in the first round, the final payoff is the earning from the POOL, 25, plus the amount it did not contribute, 10, which results in a final payoff
    of 35. For the team who contributes 12 to the POOL
    in the first round, the final payoff is the earning from the POOL, 25, plus the amount it did not contribute, 8, which results in a final payoff of 33.
