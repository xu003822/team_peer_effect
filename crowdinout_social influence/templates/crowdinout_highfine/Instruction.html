<!--<p>
Before we begin,  we want to thank you all for accepting this invitation and participating in this exercise.
The objective of this exercise is to understand how people make decisions related to the use of a shared natural resource.
    All the decisions you make, as well as all the other information you will provide us, will remain confidential.</p>-->

<p>Welcome.
This exercise attempts to create a situation where a group of individuals must make decisions on how to use a shared resource --- e.g., a forest, a water source, or a fishery.
    In the case of Xi'an, an example would be the use of (). You have been selected to participate in a group of five people among those signed up for playing.
    You will play for several rounds. At the end of the game, you will be able to earn cash.
    The cash prizes will depend on the quantity of points that you accumulate over the rounds.</p>
<p>This activity is divided into 18 rounds. At the beginning of each round, your group consists of five people share a fishery of 200 fish. In each round, each group member must decide how many fish
    between 0 and 40 to catch. This means you can catch 0, or 1, or 2, .., or 40 fish.  Each fish caught equals 1 point.  These decisions
    will be made at the same time and no communication is allowed.  At the end of the round, the number of fish doubles, up to the lake's
    capacity of 200 fish and is divided equally among the group members.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
Imagine  you  decide  to  catch  10  fish  in  a  round,  and  that  total  catch  of  other  group members are 40 fish.  This results in 150 fish left in the ocean.
    At the end of the round, the amount of fish doubles, up to the lakeâ€™s capacity of 200 fish, so there are 200 fish at the end of the round.  The 200 fish will be evenly distributed to the group members,
    Thus,  each group member will get 40 more fish at the end of the round.
    Therefore,  your total amount of fish in this round would be 10 + 40 = 50.</p>
