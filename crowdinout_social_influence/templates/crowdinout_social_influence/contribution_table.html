<p> In previous rounds, you did not observe how many fish others fished before you made your harvest decision. Now, we will
    tell you how many fish your group caught on average before you make your harvest decision. There are <b>nine</b> decisions to be
    made in this round. Each decision is independent of the other. In the end, we will randomly choose one of the nine scenarios, and your
    payment for this round will depend on your decision in that scenario.
    Note again, your catch has to be between 0 and {{max_fishh}} (inclusive).
