<p>
    As of now, you might realize that if everybody catches 20 fish, your group's aggregate earnings would be maximized, so is the average group earnings.
    By catching over 20 fish, the fish will be caught too fast.
    Therefore, at  the  beginning  of  this   round,  a regulation of maximum 20 fish may be imposed on you. Due to limited enforcement budget,
    each round only one member of each group will be imposed a regulation and there is a 10% chance that this member will be audited and pay a
    fine of 30 points for each unit of extra catch over the 20 fish.
