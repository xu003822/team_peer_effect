<p> In previous rounds, you did not know other group members' fish catch before you make your harvest decision. Now, we will
    tell you your group members' average fish catch before you make your harvest decision. There are nine decisions to be
    made in this round. Each decision is independent of the other. In the end, we will randomly choose one decision as your
    final decision in this round and your payment for this round will depend on that decision.

    Now we will show you one by one how much is your groupmates' average harvest. After you have seen this, you will decide how many fish you
    would like to catch. Note again, your catch has to be between 0 and 40 (inclusive).
